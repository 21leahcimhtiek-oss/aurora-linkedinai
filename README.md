## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Set only local or test credentials while developing. Live payment credentials and hosted checkout links are intentionally absent from this repository.

## Environment and payment safety

Required for AI responses:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Required only when enabling checkout:
- `CHECKOUT_ENABLED=true`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY`
- `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_YEARLY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

Checkout remains disabled unless `CHECKOUT_ENABLED` is explicitly set to `true` and real Stripe values are configured outside source control.

## Pricing placeholders

| Plan | Placeholder price | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Free | $0 | Local/demo access and limited AI usage. |
| Pro Monthly | $12/mo | Replace with approved Stripe Price ID before launch. |
| Pro Annual | $99/yr | Replace with approved Stripe Price ID before launch. |

## Deploy
1. Import `21leahcimhtiek-oss/aurora-linkedinai` in Vercel or your preferred host.
2. Configure environment variables from `.env.example`.
3. Keep `CHECKOUT_ENABLED=false` until pricing, tax, support, and refund terms are approved.
4. Run CI/build checks before promoting to production.

## CI
